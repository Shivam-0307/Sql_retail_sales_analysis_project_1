# Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL
### Project Overview
##### This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL. It includes data cleaning, exploration, and business insights generation to help understand key trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and product categories.

### Objectives
##### • Perform data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis.
##### • Conduct data exploration to summarize key metrics.
##### • Address business questions such as top-selling products, high-value customers, and sales trends over time.
##### • Use SQL queries for aggregations, filtering, and categorization to gain valuable insights.

### Dataset Description
##### The dataset consists of retail transactions with the following attributes:
##### • transaction_id: Unique identifier for each sale
##### • sales_date: Date of the transaction
##### • sales_time: Time of purchase
##### • customer_id: Unique ID for each customer
##### • gender: Gender of the customer
##### • age: Customer's age
##### • category: Product category (e.g., Clothing, Beauty, Electronics)
##### • quantity: Number of items purchased
##### • price_per_unit: Price per item
##### • cogs: Cost of goods sold
##### • total_sales: Total sales value per transaction

### Key Analyses Performed
##### ◘ Data Cleaning: Identified and removed NULL values to maintain data integrity.
##### ◘ Exploratory Data Analysis: Counted total sales, unique customers, and product categories.
##### ◘ Business Insights:
      ##### • Identified sales trends over time.
      ##### • Found top-selling categories and high-value customers.
      ##### • Analyzed transactions based on different shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). 
      ##### • Calculated total revenue per category and customer segment.

### SQL Queries Used
##### • Aggregation Queries: To calculate total sales, average age, and number of transactions per category.
##### • Filtering & Conditional Queries: To extract transactions for specific categories, high-value sales, and sales on particular dates.
##### • Grouping Queries: To segment data by gender, category, and sales shifts.

### Conclusion
#####  This project provides a structured approach to retail sales analysis using SQL, helping businesses understand their sales performance, optimize inventory, and improve customer targeting strategies.
